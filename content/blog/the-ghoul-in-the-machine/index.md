where am i at?

I've been struggling as of late to articulate the general anxiety and unease I feel beyond "things feel bad" and that "they don't seem to be getting better". Particularly, a [recently published study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872) regarding AI's usage and its effect on cognition provided a headline and summary that confirms a feeling I've felt in my own work: AI in 2025, while a marvelous and brilliant innovation, is making me stupid.

The fact the study focused on essay writing as the task at hand indicates to me a generalized effect on cognition - to write necessarily means to order one's thoughts and to reason. Beyond that, it is also an act of individual expression and of community: up until the very recent present, words were written by people for other people - to teach, to inform, to inspire, to incense, to _affect_. If someone cannot explain something well, they probably don't understand it well.

what is going on?

This leads into what I see on the ground in my day-to-day in my work life and (lesser so) in my real life: nobody is talking anymore. We are sending AI-generated emails, we are engaging in AI-assisted Slack correspondence, we rely on the composing and interpretation of AI summarizations against workplace documents and information, we are encouraged and happily allow AI to write our software - does any of this matter if a (very fancy) Markov chain can substitute tokens in place of actual human speech? Perhaps the workplace is an increasingly shallow, mechanical, and narrowing space for humans to operate in, similar to the specializing effect of the industrial revolution - cogs in the machine.

There is no doubt that, in a general sense, this technology can be leveraged to make our lives easier. I've found it to be an incredible resource when leveraged as a supercharged search engine. But, proper and responsible usage isn't guaranteed, and the owners of said systems have no reason to only encourage the good parts. In fact, they have every reason to encourage adoption in general - there is money to be made. We are still in the loss leader phase of the business cycle, meaning Big AI wants to get you hooked.

Why read your TPS report when AI can provide you the Coles Notes pretty accurately? Well, we had the same predicament in our educational years learning how to read and write: why bother reading the book if you can find the summary online? I will argue the point that it is not so much the destination that matters, but the journey, because only people can produce things that are new, unique, novel, and inspired, and that happens through the labour of doing-the-thing, not in having it done.

what rings the alarm bell for me?

Recently I read [The Human Condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Condition_(Arendt_book)). In brief, Arendt categorizes human activity into three categories: labour, work, and action. Labour is the toil to maintain our base needs: growing crops to eat, washing the dishes, mowing the lawn, and so forth. Work is the act of fabrication or craftsmanship, my reading of which situates it similarly to the Greek [techne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techne). Action is the acts through which we differentiate ourselves from one another and through which our humanity is expressed, and in my reading of it, is how the things that actually matter happen. Importantly, a key characteristic of action is that it is unpredictable - an notable contrast from today's AI which is necessarily a predictable thing.
