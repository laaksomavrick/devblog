where am i at?

I've been struggling as of late to articulate the general anxiety and dis-ease I feel beyond "things feel bad" and that "they don't seem to be getting better". Particularly, a [recently published study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872) regarding AI's usage and its effect on cognition provided a headline and summary that confirms a feeling I've felt in my own work: AI in 2025, while a marvelous and brilliant innovation, is making me stupid.

The fact the study focused on essay writing as the task at hand indicates to me a generalized effect on cognition - to write necessarily means to order one's thoughts and to reason. Beyond that, it is also an act of individual expression and of community: up until the very recent present, words were written by people for other people - to teach, to inform, to inspire, to incense, to _affect_. If someone cannot explain something well, they probably don't understand it well.

what is going on?

Recently I read [The Human Condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Condition_(Arendt_book)). In brief, Arendt categorizes human activity into three categories: labour, work, and action. Labour is the toil to maintain our base needs: growing crops to eat, washing the dishes, mowing the lawn, and so forth. Work is the act of fabrication or craftsmanship, my reading of which situates it similarly to the Greek [techne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techne). Action is the acts through which we differentiate ourselves from one another and through which our humanity is expressed, and in my reading of it, is how the things that actually matter happen.



what rings the alarm bell for me?

factories, calculators, editors

why don't they apply given the problems identified in 3?
what can we do?
